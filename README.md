## Introduction
Airbnb, founded in 2007, has become the largest hotel company globally, boasting over 1 billion guests and 4 million hosts in 191 countries as of October 2021. Despite not owning any hotel buildings, the platform connects people seeking accommodations with those offering their properties. In early 2023, the company reported nearly $2 billion in net earnings for 2022, with a remarkable 20% annual growth. This success challenges traditional hotel networks.

## Problem Definition

## Data Overview
The data was extracted from the Inside Airbnb website. The file, named listings.csv, encompasses information as of May 2021. Opting for a condensed file over the complete dataset was considered appropriate for the preliminary analysis, serving the purposes of this study.

## Conclusion
The "New York Airbnb Analysis" project gives a thorough understanding of how people rent homes for short stays in New York. By carefully studying the data, the project aims to share useful information with tourists in the hotel industry.
